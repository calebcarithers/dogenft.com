  "description": "DOG turns 1! Memes rule the internet, and 1 year ago we democratized the internet by decentralizing the ownership of its most famous meme.\nOn August 30th, 2021, PleasrDAO fractionalized The Doge NFT giving birth to DOG, a token representing ownership of the OG Doge meme.\nTo commemorate 1 year of wholesomeness, fun, dogely values and philanthropy on the blockchain, we have launched our very special birthday edition soulbound token series for supporters who held DOG on-chain (Ethereum, Arbitrum, BSC, Polygon, or Optimism) and/or Doge Pixels, before August 30th, 2022.\nThis NFT is a clip from our music video titled “In Doge We Trust” which was created in collaboration with Bassjackers, pplpleasr, and cloudeatr.\nIt not only establishes you as a respectable member of our DOG universe but also gives you the right to call yourself a Dogen!\n",
